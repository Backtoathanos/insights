We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on

					referred you to our site (e.g. a search engine). <br> <br>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly
					around marketing and advertising.<br> <br>
We generally only send electronic marketing - such as email marketing - to people who have
					previously bought similar products from us and this is in our legitimate interests. We
					will always offer a way out of receiving this marketing when you first purchase our
					products and in every marketing communication afterwards. We may on occasion send out
					postal marketing for the purpose of growing our sales which is in our legitimate interests
					and in this scenario we will rely on you to let us know if you do not want to receive this
					by opting out of marketing (see Opting out below).<br> <br>
Where you have not previously bought from us but have registered your details with us (for
					example by signing up for a newsletter), we will only send you marketing communications if
					you opted into receiving marketing at the time and so given us your express consent (which
					you may withdraw at any time – see Opting out below).
